As part of the course, **CMPE 146: Real-Time Embedded Systems**, students worked in teams of 3 to build an MP3 Player in a **Real-Time Operating System** enviornment. For this course we used a **custom microcontroller** built by NXP and needed to develop all the necessary drivers to include all of our required functions.

Roles Included:
- Developed a working MP3 Player using an LPC408x/407x, a custom microcontroller utilizing an **ARM Cortex-M4 CPU**
- Designed the software in the **C programming language** and built using the SCons tool from a **Linux terminal**
- Implement a **real-time operating system** in FreeRTOS using tasks, queues, and semaphores
- Reviewed several technical **datasheets** and user manuals to properly implement various **device drivers** for **hardware peripherals** such as GPIO, ADC, integrate an MP3 decoder through the SPI bus, and the LCD through UART communication

This was a very **challenging** but largely **rewarding** project! Our team spent several hours working together and **collaborating** in locating important sections from the datasheets and hours of **debugging** our system, and in the end we were able to complete our product!
