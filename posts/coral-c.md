This Web App is our teams' Senior Capstone Project as part of San Jose State University's **Department of Computer Engineering**.
Utilizing the MERN Stack Toolset, we developed the Front-End with React and the Back-End with MongoDB.

Roles Included:
- Developed a web application, for locating essential resources specifically for low-income communities
- Applied the MERN Stack tool set to build the website, tools include MongoDB, Express, React and Node.js
- Designed the Landing Page for the website in JavaScript and assisted in integrating Google Maps API functionality

This project became more revelant as the **COVID-19 Pandemic** caused massive shutdowns with thousands of people enrolling for **unemployment benefits** and the search for food, health and shelter assistance becoming a necessity for low-income communities.
