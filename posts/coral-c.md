This Web App is our teams' Senior Capstone Project as part of San Jose State University's **Department of Computer Engineering**.
Utilizing the MERN Stack Toolset, we developed the Front-End with React and the Back-End with MongoDB.

Roles Included:
- Developed a **web application**, for locating essential resources specifically for low-income communities
- Applied the **MERN Stack toolset** to build the website, tools include **MongoDB, Express, React and Node.js**
- Designed for **ease-of-use** by implementing features such as a **Google Maps API** for locating resources

This project became more revelant as the **COVID-19 Pandemic** caused massive shutdowns with thousands of people enrolling for **unemployment benefits** and the search for food, health and shelter assistance becoming a necessity for low-income communities.
