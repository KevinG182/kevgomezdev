SOLES is San Jose State University's Student Chapter for both the Society of Hispanic Professional Engineers **(SHPE)** and **MAES**- Latinos in Tech. I have been a member and on the board in different positions for about 3 years. This time includes a year as a **Science Extravaganza Co-Chair / Treasurer** and a year as the **SOLES Secretary**.

As part of my roles with the **Society of Latino Engineers and Scientists** I would constantly promote the organization and deploy strategies to increase our membership and during the time I was on the board, we saw an **increase of over 100 students in peak membership!** This was done through recruitment and networking events, but as Secretary I had the additional roles of crafting a **weekly newsletter** to keep our members interested and **design posters and short films** to attract new interests. 

Roles Included:
- Created sponsorship proposals that **increased our yearly budget by $2700,** an estimated 35% growth
- **Quintupled membership** to 138 members over 3 years through developing recruitment strategies
- Engaged **over 300 students** at each Science Extravaganza 2019 and 2020 and hosted SJSUâ€™s largest student organized event by presenting to 7 local middle schools **to encourage thousands of young students to pursue higher education** in Science, Technology, Engineering and Math
- During this time, helped **expand the scope of resources** by being a **co-founder** and function as **Treasurer** to **SJSU's new SACNAS Chapter** (Society for the Advancement of Chicanos/Hispanics and Native Americans in Science)

SOLES has been my **favorite organization** on the SJSU campus and assisting in **growing the community** has been a great experience!
